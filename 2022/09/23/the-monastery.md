Brother Thomas carried the heavy wooden buckets down the cramped stone
stairs. Spiraling down into darkness, the stairs were far too narrow to
take on with a bucket in each hand, so he went down sideways, pausing on
each step to steady his balance before moving down to the next stp.
Keeping the soapy water in the buckets was a matter of safety -- slipping
on one of these steps could kill a man.

Brother Michael was ahead of him on the stairs carrying the brushes, the mop,
and the lantern. Being the junior-most member of the Order by at least
fifteen years, Michael should, by all rights, be carrying the buckets; but
he was also, by far, the least careful monk to call the monastery home.
This was was Michael's fourth position here, and had somehow managed last
week to -- despite the safety glass on the lantern -- light the mop on
fire.

Today, oblivious to the purpose he served as lamp holder, Michael
had rushed ahead down the stairs and left Thomas in the dark.
Fortunately, this was not Thomas' first time at this task, and it
was impossible to get lost in a stairwell.

Thomas came through the arch at the bottom of the stairs and
paused to let his eyes adjust to the light.  The first thing he could
see was the shining face of Brother Michael looking at him with a smile of
satisfaction on his face as though he a done a good job.

Thomas sighed as set the buckets down.

"Thank you for carefully lighting the way, Brother Michael."

"You're welcome, Brother Thomas!"

Thomas stood for a few moments and stared at Brother Michael.  The
fact that his face never changed from that proud smile confirmed that
sarcasm was beyond his ken.

"Very good," said Thomas, "The lamp is burning and we've work to
do." He bent at the knees to pick up the buckets. "Would you be so kind
as to open the door?"

"Of course," said Michael, as he hung the lantern on a hook by the door
and then carefully set down the brushes and mop as if they were made of
glass.

Having resumed his heavy burden, Brother Thomas was only slightly annoyed
to see that the brushes and mop had been laid in his path.

"Along the wall, Brother," he said, looking from the cleaning equipment to
the wall.

"Oh!  Yes, right," said Michael as he pushed them towards the wall with his
foot before turning his attention to the brass pressure door.

The door was oblong, about twice as high as it was wide, with two large
wing-handled nuts opposite a reinforced double hinge.  Even in this light
one could see the door was oxidized from the damp and that it would be
difficult to open.

Michael drew a wooden mallet from somewhere in his robe and struck the
handles three or four times each to crack them loose. He then stuffed the
mallet back into his robe and backed the two wing-nuts clean off the
threads, then set them on the ground next to the brushes and mop.

Thomas, having set the buckets down near the door, withdrew a pry bar from
his robes and handed it to Michael.

"If you'll do the honors."

Michael took off his robe and set it on a hook in the wall, leaving him
wearing something that resembled a loincloth. He then took the pry bar and
set to work at the door.  The tarred rope seal would be like hardened glue
by now, and it was going to take quite some effort to get it open.
Clearing the seal at the top and bottom of the door was usually done first
because the surface area was smaller, but Brother Michael would have none
of that.  Instead, he set the pry bar at the side of the door opposite the
hinge and gave a mighty pull, the kind of pull that can only be peformed by
the young and inexperienced.  After straining and grunting for what felt like
minutes, the seal finally broke and the door cracked open.

Thomas extended his hand, and Michael gave him back the pry bar.

"Excellent work," said Thomas as he squirreled away the pry bar.  "Now
finish with the door and we'll make quick work of cleaning the dry well."

The door hinges were stiff, so Michael once again put his back into it and
slowly pulled the door open.  As he did so, a pale hand fell through the door
opening and clanged against the door flange.  The light from the lamp hanging
by the door cast a slim beam into the well, and Thomas could just make out a
human form in the dim light.

"Call the Abbot, Brother Michael.  And hurry!"
