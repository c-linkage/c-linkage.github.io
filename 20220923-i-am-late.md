# I Am Late

"God damnit."

Of all the days for the subway to break down it had to be today. He
*knew* he was cutting it close when he left this morning, but he couldn't stop
listening to that voice in his head: "It's okay! You missed the 8:25, but
the 8:40 will still get you there in plenty of time."  

"If only I hadn't sat on my ass scrolling though my feed I wouldn't be in this 
mess," Jack thought to himself. "I'm such a fucking idiot." 

He kept checking his watch as the minutes ticked by. Jack's father had told
him how important this interview was. A lot of favors had been called in to
arrange it, and now it was looking like he'd be a no-show. He couldn't even
get a message out on his phone because, well, he was underground, and the
ticket he bought didn't include access to the train operator's wireless network.

The overhead speaker buzzed so much that the announcement was almost
incomprehensible: "Attention passengers. The train will begin moving
momentarily. We apologize for the inconvenience." Halfway though the
message the car jerked as the slack was taken out of the couplings. 

Finally underway, the jigging of his leg only intensified. If he had missed the
interview entirely then the broken train would have been the perfect
excuse.  But now he was going to be *late*.  He was certainly going to be
late by his father's standards -- "If you're not ten minutes early, you're
late!" -- but he was going to be later than that.

"I can't tell them I was late because I was on my feed," Jack thought.
"They'd think I'm and idiot! I need a better excuse.  Something critical.
But not so critical that they could find out about it on the news.
Something like, a guy had a heart attack on the stairs to the platform and
the paramedics blocked access making me miss my train. Yeah, that should do
it."

As the train pulled into the station, Jack stood up and pushed his way to
the door. The "ding" of the arrival bell was a like a starting pistol and 
Jack shot through the partly opened doors, bouncing off passengers waiting
to board. He ran up the steps and sprinted down Milton Avenue towards the
glass-covered tower that architecturally screamed "The building means
business!"

As Jack dodged pedestrians he sneaked a look at his watch. Seven minutes.
He had seven minutes to get there. It was possible, but he'd be a sweaty
mess by the time he got there. "I could tell them I ran all the way there
to make it on time. They'd see how serious I can be!" 

With just two minutes to spare, Jack skidded to a halt at the front door of the 
408 Building. Using the glass door as a mirror, he wiped the sweat from
his forehead and fixed his hair. The cold blast of air that greeted him
upon opening the door helped relax him as he tried his best to stroll
confidently across the lobby toward the elevator.

Ding!

The elevator door opened just as Jack arrived, so he boarded the car with
the clutch of waiting passengers. They each took up positions in the car
according to the customs of personal space, and pressed the buttons for
their floors.
